I'm learning Python and I really love it. My goal is to get the PCEP 30 entry-level certification by July.  I've been learning from different sources like YouTube and Udemy. But for some reason, even though I've been learning in my native language, Spanish, I reached a point where it became hard to keep going—either because I stopped understanding some concepts or maybe because of the way they were explained.  Luckily, I'm also very familiar with English, and one day I came across your YouTube channel. And believe me when I say this—it felt like I came back to life. The way you explain things is so different from what I was used to. You're so good at teaching that you brought back the motivation I was starting to lose. You make everything seem so easy.  So thank you so much for your contribution to the community. I hope one day I’ll be able to support your channel with a donation.

(I try and guess what will come next to test myself more). I then posted my code into Grok (X's LLM) and asked how I get it to loop around. It suggested two things for me.  - Starting with: While True: (and ends in break). As well as affixing .upper() to the input.   I had tried on previous lessons to do something like: (example:)  If user_input == ""Y"" or ""y"":   - that of course failed. But it's good to learn and i'm still a noob. Thank you for this course.

That's when I realized excel wasn't going to be enough and I don't want to pay subscriptions every time I want something (like extracting data from 1000 pdf invoices) and so I thought maybe if I get good at python I can automate/program a bot to do it FOR me and for free ANDDDDD if I'm good with coding, I'll for sure get paid so much better than anyone else as an accountant, I'll be able to do the job of 9999 data entry accountants all by myself with no limits (CRAZY!!).  Please anyone!! tell me if what I'm saying is possible with python or am I TRIPPIN and doing all this for nothing aHAHAH :(((  EDIT: If 5 people answer my question with certitude, I'll donate 5$ :)",thank much bro graduated accounting diploma college start university jan long ago treating invoices pdf used chat gpt efficient tool extract wanted data invoice slow make mistakes handle big load ayoo realized excel going enough want pay subscriptions every time want something like extracting data pdf invoices thought maybe get good python automate program bot free andd good coding sure get paid much better anyone else accountant able job data entry accountants limits crazy please anyone tell saying possible python trippin nothing ahahah edit people answer question certitude donate,0.967,positive
