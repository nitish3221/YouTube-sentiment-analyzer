I'm in a situation that doesn't enable me to have internet all the time. I can get to places that have power with no internet to study, but I can't always have access to internet at any hour. Circumstances are, well, just what they are for me at this point in my life. It's why I'm trying with everything I have, to learn how to program and code front end also. But I'm really getting interested in Python, but finding offline use lessons, are well, quite far and few in between also. If they aren't I understand. I will still make this work for me some how. I have too. I appreciate what you do for all of us! I know I'm not the only, but no matter, thank you very much! Any pointers on  where to look or search for other lesson resources would very much appreciated also!"

I'm learning Python and I really love it. My goal is to get the PCEP 30 entry-level certification by July.  I've been learning from different sources like YouTube and Udemy. But for some reason, even though I've been learning in my native language, Spanish, I reached a point where it became hard to keep going—either because I stopped understanding some concepts or maybe because of the way they were explained.  Luckily, I'm also very familiar with English, and one day I came across your YouTube channel. And believe me when I say this—it felt like I came back to life. The way you explain things is so different from what I was used to. You're so good at teaching that you brought back the motivation I was starting to lose. You make everything seem so easy.  So thank you so much for your contribution to the community. I hope one day I’ll be able to support your channel with a donation.  Greetings from Mexico!"

In the beginning I would get errors from the system which is very helpful for me when trying to understand the coding a lot better and why certain things I'm trying to code will work or not. None the less great video and I can't wait to finish this and see where I am at compared to when I started with no experience coding whatsoever.

I now currently understand the very basics and don’t look at a string and get overwhelmed   I will say, learning from nothing is like drinking water from a fire hose   My goal is to finish this 12hr video over the next 24hrs.   Day 1 - 4/23/25 45 minutes in, (but about 10 hours on the computer asking Grok questions about things I was confused on, referencing other material, and testing myself with Grok generated questions. )   For those starting out like me, use Grok as a private tutor to ask the same questions as you would if you were asking the person teaching this video. Then ask grok to create code that you can fix (if you don’t understand the same things I didn’t and when to apply them )  and even ask Grok to check your practice codes and explain any errors. This is helping me tremendously.   My goal is to be hire ready for an entry level position in 2 months.  I’ll be posting updates on this comment to help encourage others!"

I ran the stopwatch program and it crashed, giving error 'Process finished with exit code -1073740791 (0xC0000409)'. I found that it crashes when 'self.timer.start(10)' is executed (after clicking the start button). If I comment it out, the program won't crash. Of course it won't run either. If I comment out 'self.time = self.time.addMSec(10)' and keep 'self.timer.start(10)' active, the program won't crash either, but the app won't be working. Why does the program crash?"

They are asking to do things that were not talked or discussed during the lectures.  I stumbled upon your video's yesterday and was hoping this wasn't going to be another ""dead end"".  Within the first 10 minutes I had already gained so much information of what was being asked in my other workbooks.

And the crazy thing is i already learned everything up until this time stamp. i can do the double click to highlight and ctrlC & V but i will never be able to keep up with the speed he is doing this. Also question low or high mouse dpi for coding? I saved this vid ab a week after drop bc ik one day i wanted to refresh my skills bc i was out of practice. This video literally feels like piracy bc its 95% the exact same learning quality as a collage. this would be ab $600 anywhere else (textbook not included)  network chuck  and BroCodez definitely perma closed some collages somewhere that were overrated

I've been trying to code ahead to see if I can get it, super fun!     At 1:05:47,    (somehow) I was able to do the same thing with just 15 lines of code.  I left out your 'result' lines by just building them into the print function, like this :      op = input(""Enter an operator (+ - * or /)"") num1 = float(input(""Enter the first number:  "")) num2 = float(input(""Enter the second number:  "")) if op == ""+"":     print(""Your sum is : "", (num1 + num2)) elif op == ""-"":     print(""Your difference is : "", (num1 - num2)) elif op == ""*"":     print(""Your product is : "", (num1 * num2)) elif op == ""/"":     print(""Your quotient is : "", (round(num1 / num2, 3))) else:     print(f""Your operator, ({op}), is not valid. Please use :  +  -  *  /  only "")  Seems to work great, unless I put something besides a number in num1 or num2, then it crashes.     Cheers and Thanks!"

But need a full emersion so its second nature by the time I graduate. Also, going to be practicing a few hours a day the more complex syntax im not fully familiar with.   Thank you for this, i like to go the full emersion route so this long video allows me to hear it the whole time I sleep, (i do this with everything) and then my brain makes since of it all easier when i see it in my wake hours.   When Im trying to perfect something i go full throttle emersion and it just works for me. Especially since i hear it everyday anyhow. Gotta make it impossible to forget. Plus, I already passed my sql and python classes so just growing now."

I posted my code for the temperature conversion (that I tried to do before the beginning of that chapter, my math was slightly wrong for the C to F. (I try and guess what will come next to test myself more). I then posted my code into Grok (X's LLM) and asked how I get it to loop around. It suggested two things for me.  - Starting with: While True: (and ends in break). As well as affixing .upper() to the input.   I had tried on previous lessons to do something like: (example:)  If user_input == ""Y"" or ""y"":   - that of course failed. But it's good to learn and i'm still a noob. Thank you for this course. I am enjoying it. I also use an app called mimo in the evening to test my knowledge too (other apps available) Here was my code:  #temperature conversion programme while True:     unit = float(input(""Please enter the temperature: ""))     unit_type = input(""is this in Celsius or Fahrenheit (C/F): "").upper()      if unit_type == ""C"":         temp = round((unit * 9) / 5 + 32, 1)         fahrenheit = ""°F""         print(f"" {unit}oC to fahrenheit is: {temp}{fahrenheit}"")     elif unit_type == ""F"":         temp = round((unit - 32) * 5 / 9)         celsius = ""°C""         print(f""{unit} converted into celsius is: {temp}{celsius}"")     else:         print(""Sorry you entered an invalid type."")      another_go = input(""Would you like to convert another temperature?

Should be tough (considering tight schedule) but manageable. (Goal set on 30/01/2025) [Goal Complete]  Edit: I'm just doing this to journal my progress. I am a student who works part time and lives alone. Just trying to show everyone you can still learn on a busy schedule as long as you're consistent.   Final Edit: This is proof even on a busy schedule if you are consistent you can do it. Good Luck!!"

I started with 0 knowledge in programming (I work in finance). I had to go through the second half a little faster just so I could get a better and fuller picture of how Python actually works. But now I can say the anxiety of learning programming has considerably diminished :). I aim to start doing some random exercises I can find on the internet so I can actually memorize and build some muscle memory, I will for sure consistently return to the video and recap the lessons.

That way it could allow viewers to attempt the projects using the information their aware of before being showed a solution. I think it would be really beneficial and help improve the confidence and coding abilities of the viewers."

That's when I realized excel wasn't going to be enough and I don't want to pay subscriptions every time I want something (like extracting data from 1000 pdf invoices) and so I thought maybe if I get good at python I can automate/program a bot to do it FOR me and for free ANDDDDD if I'm good with coding, I'll for sure get paid so much better than anyone else as an accountant, I'll be able to do the job of 9999 data entry accountants all by myself with no limits (CRAZY!!).

To be completely honest, it has been quite a long time since the last time I try to challenge myself and try to learn some new skill, from zero. I've failed a lot in the past on my other endeavours. I thought I just didn't have the grid to push through a learning curve. I thought I was weak-willed.  But this time, I really really try my best to commit to programming. And somehow, I managed to complete the whole course, thanks to you.  I know this is just the beginning. After this, I need to train myself, make my own projects from scratch, train in leetcode, learn some new programming language that complements my python knowledge, etc. rinse and repeat.  But even if a lot of people have thanked you, I still think I need to add my own thanks on top of that. Sometimes, what someone need is just that gentle nudge, that 'push' to start something, anything.  And once they get through that starting barrier, suddenly, everything is possible. I can see that now. Finally.  Thank you so much Bro, I'll owe you forever. From the bottom of my heart, Thank You. ❤"

That saboteur known as Chat GPT will continuously  change the function names so unless you tell it explicitly do not change the names of function unless your making a new function it will make your learning curve far greater then it needs to be .

Ik i should put some while loop if the user doesnt put number inputs, i did forget about that. But my program ask the user to put the lowest and the highest number in wich order he prefers with the range he prefers the most. Ik, if you put a range like 1000 u will play this game for a really long time. Maybe i have to put some inputs to break the game if the user doesnt want to play anymore. Or maybe i like suffering. That's my program! What do you think about?"

Would this code actually be used this way?

When the clock struck 5, the pizza wore off and the Saturn became an silly cactus again. The cheese turned back into a burger. The maiden cow went to their room to check upon them and they were nowhere to be found. At last, they discovered a secret which made the cow aware of what was actually happening. So the maiden cow went to the Sorceress castle to obtain the pizza potion to turn the two ghouls back into a cheese and Saturn again. They lived scarily ever after."

I spelled ""background"" wrong for example.   2. If the profile image is not showing up in the GUI,  ensure the image is small enough resolution, something like  a PNG file type, add it into your main python files folder with your smaller python practice file. It should now show up automatically in VSCode above or below your practice file. Now instead of typing the name, double click on the image file in VScode, then click ""copy to relative path"". Paste that instead of writing the name of the file like bro code does and it will work."

I literally don't know anything about coding. I'm just zero in it. Even in classes they don't teach so deep. Your video is just making me pro in python.   I suggest all of you guys to learn this full 12 hours video. Daily giving one hour means 12 days you are pro in python.  Thank you so much for this video. You just saved my life since I was struggling so much.

To my surprise, after a couple of errors that I sorted out, I came up with this (probably grotesque) code that works great! (other than with words that are spelled the same in both singular and plural forms)  item = input(""What item would you like to buy?:"") price = float(input(""what is the price?: $"")) quantity = int(input(f""How many {item}s would you like to buy?:"")) total = price * quantity if quantity > 1:     print(f""You have bought {quantity} {item}s"") else:     print(f""You have bought {quantity} {item}"") print(f""Your total is ${total}"")  The (if/else) wasn't noted in this exercise and it prints the plural spelling of the item being bought if buying more than 1 of said item!   I know it's not much but I felt very accomplished and needed to share it with the world lol. For context, I have never been very computer savvy and have been working in physical labor positions for the last 6 years so I decided to see if I can work toward furthering my education and move into a less physically stressful career field!

I came here to watch the video about the difference between break, continue, and pass and casually saw this on top of your channel, and I have to say I was stunned when I saw this. I'm not gonna go through it now cause I need to stick to my plan and not mess it up and end up confused. However I must make some time to check this video man, I MUST know if you really did cover the whole language in just 12 HOURS!!! I'm still a bit shocked lol Quick question, I'm learning how to be a backend programmer, does this include frontend material? Like app building and widgets controls...etc. I read the description but just wanna make sure."

I see that every time he starts something new indicated by the hashtag symbol he deletes previous code examples. I don't so it ends up running all the codes. I want to save the previous codes in the same place so I can start new codes so it don't end up running all other previous code how do I do that? And just in case I get a late reply and I attempt to do it how do I put the new code in the same folder as the main one?

Ode to the Code Master A beacon of knowledge, a digital guide, He teaches the code, with boundless pride. From novice to expert, he leads the way, In the realm of programming, day by day. With lines of code, he paints the screen, A masterpiece of logic, a digital scene. He shares his wisdom, freely and bright, A guiding star in the coding night. So let us praise him, this coding guru, For his passion, his skill, and his virtu. A teacher, a mentor, a friend so true, May his knowledge forever renew."

Ugzm8VWOvCsKydOhzgx4AaABAg,@Hassan-do3om,2024-09-15T17:00:00Z,0,"Genuine question.   Is there a reason to learn Python (or any programming language for that matter) now that AI can pretty much write the code for you?  I'm starting to think that there is no point in learning Python if AI can just write the code for you in a matter of seconds while, on the other hand, you would be slaving away for hours at a screen trying to figure out where your missing bug is.  I could be (and probably am very) wrong about my assumption, but I would like some clarity and I would like to build myself a roadmap to Software Engineering since I am very interested in the topic.  I have recently started learning Python and whenever I see that AI can just blurt out your code in mere seconds I kind of get a little let down because I know that the project I would spend hours working on as a beginner and be very happy about can be done with no effort.  I am also scared that the job market in the future will not need actual Software Engineers and just substitute us with AI and therefore my efforts would go to waste"

You really really helped me to learn c++, c#, javascript and python. I also watched the first hour of your html+css course which was amazing. your explanations are clear, straight to the point. and also ngl, the course's greatest thing is your charming voice.  Thank you for uploading these 4-12 hours long courses completely for over 2 million people for completely free, and most of them are fundraisers. we need more people like you.   i even watched videos of mosh hamedani and i always felt like something is off but after finding you just by searching ""C calculator program"", i can literally say that this is the best channel ever.  and for people who is reading this comment, don't give up. happy coding!  print(""Bye!"")"

The while loop which will re-prompt me if I entered an invalid username and using break correctly, indentation really matters! Remember to try these exercises yourself before BroCode shows you how to do them! You will learn better!  My solution to the username exercise:   invalid = ""Username is invalid"" while True:     username = input(""Insert Username: (No spaces, digits and under 12 characters) "")      if len(username) > 12 or not username.isalpha():       print(invalid)     else:       print(f""Welcome {username}"")       break"
